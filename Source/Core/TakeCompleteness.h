/// File size alone cannot see the failure that matters most here. A device

/// carried signal -- produces stems that are megabytes long and completely
/// flat. takeHoldsNoAudio weighs bytes, so it calls that a recording, and the
/// app says "Saved." over a folder holding nothing. §0.1 names unreported loss
/// as the one unacceptable failure, and that is exactly what it is.
///
/// `peakAbs` is the largest absolute sample value the take wrote, or negative
/// when nobody measured one -- in which case silence is never reported, because
/// a measurement that was not taken is not evidence.
///
/// The silence bar is -90 dBFS. Real microphone paths carry preamp noise far
/// above that even in a quiet room, so a whisper still counts as a recording;
/// only a genuinely dead stream falls under it.

///
/// The two can disagree, and when they do it is the most important thing the
/// app knows: audio reaching the capture path and not reaching the files is a
/// fault in this program, not in the user's rig. Without this the take is
/// simply "silent", and someone spends an hour checking cables and mute
/// switches that were never the problem.
///
/// `peakArrived` negative means nobody measured it, and the verdict falls back
/// to what the files and the written peak alone can say.
