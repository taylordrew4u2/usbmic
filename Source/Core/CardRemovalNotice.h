/// immediately, finalize every open file, alert loudly. If the mirror is
/// running, state that a complete copy survives locally and give its path."
///
/// The path is the whole point of the second sentence. A user told only that
/// the card failed has lost their take as far as they know; a user given the
/// folder that still holds it has had an accident rather than a disaster, which
/// is exactly what §6.3 built the mirror for.
