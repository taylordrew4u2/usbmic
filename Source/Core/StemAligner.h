/// Every microphone reaches the headphone mix as early as its own device
/// allows: a device that reports more input latency, or runs at a larger IO
/// block, hands its audio over later, and nothing on the monitor path waits
/// for it. So the samples the writer receives are not lined up -- a clap two
/// interfaces heard at once arrives in their channels that many samples
/// apart. Each channel is delayed here by its offset (the slowest device's
/// latency less its own), through a delay line per channel, so the clap lands
/// on the same frame in every stem and the mix summed from them.
///
/// A channel's offset can change mid-take, when a device's IO block grows:
///  - Longer: the channel is held back further by writing silence into it
///    at once while its audio waits in the delay line -- nothing it handed
///    over is lost, it comes out later.
///  - Shorter: the channel's own device has grown its block and its stream
///    has just moved later by putting exactly that much silence in
///    (DeviceInputStream moves once, by the growth). That silence is what
///    is taken out: the run of it already waiting at the newest end of the
///    line, then whatever of it is still arriving. Only what neither finds
///    -- audio arrived first -- comes out of the newest samples waiting, so
///    a growth on a device that is not the slowest leaves its stem
///    seamless.
///  - A shorter offset for a block the device has not confirmed is applied
///    the same way, at once, while the move's silence is still at the newest
///    end of the line -- and remembered. When the device refuses that block
///    (a driver handed a backlog over in one piece, and the stream moved
///    nothing in the end), the longer offset that follows puts that silence
///    back exactly where it was taken from, behind the samples that were
///    waiting ahead of it, and neither change is counted: the stem is as if
///    nothing had happened. Writing fresh silence at the head instead put
///    the audio still waiting from before the backlog's gap after it.
///  - The offset set before a channel's first sample is the take's starting
///    alignment: the leading channels start with that much silence.
///
/// What is still in a line when the take stops is audio from after the
/// slowest device's last sample, past the aligned end of the take, and is not
/// written: every stem holds exactly the frames the take accepted.
