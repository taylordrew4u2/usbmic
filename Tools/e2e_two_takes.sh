# A gig is not one take. Every other gate here starts the app, records once and
# exits, so nothing exercised the second take -- and the second take is where
# this codebase has historically gone wrong: CaptureCoordinator carries comments
# about take three's record carrying take one's losses, and about overrunSamples
# being "the one counter here that was not" reset with its siblings.
#
# Two takes in ONE app session, and then:
#
#   * both takes must be complete and correct on their own
#   * they must be separate folders, not one overwritten by the other
#   * take two's reported loss must be TAKE TWO'S, not both takes summed
#
# The third is the interesting one. The counters are per-take by design, so a
# regression that stops resetting them makes take two's figure roughly the sum
# of both -- about double. The bound below is deliberately loose (1.6x against
# an expected ~1.0x) so ordinary run-to-run variation cannot trip it while a
# doubling cannot hide.
