# What the next launch does after a crash, a force-quit or a power cut.
#
#   Tools/e2e_crash_recovery.sh
#
# Runs the REAL app, headless, in a throwaway HOME (its own settings folder,
# recordings and ~/.asoundrc), on its own Xvfb display, and checks:
#
#   1. Hidden temporary files a crash strands mid-replace of settings.json and
#      of a show template are removed at launch -- and the stranded show is not
#      offered as a show.
#   2. A save location that is NOT mounted at launch (macOS checks a card for
#      minutes after an unclean shutdown before it mounts) is checked for an
#      interrupted take once it appears: the take's WAV header is repaired, the
#      take's own stranded temp file is removed, and it is not yet marked as
#      dealt with (that is the card's Done).
#   3. An interrupted take with nothing playable in it (crash within a second
#      of Record) is marked as dealt with by the scan, so it is not announced
#      again at every launch.
#   4. SIGKILL mid-take on a real recording: the next launch repairs every
#      stem's header from the bytes on disk. A microphone dies part way
#      through first (Tools/alsa_readi_shim.cpp), and the take's session.json
#      -- the record the kill leaves behind -- has to say so: it used to be
#      written at Record and at Stop only, so it never did.
#   5. A locked card (a read-only mount): its copy of an interrupted take
#      cannot be repaired, while the local backup copy can. The backup copy is
#      the one offered, and the log says why. Needs mount (root); skipped
#      otherwise.
#
# Needs Xvfb, xdotool. MMA_DISPLAY picks the display (default :163); only the
# Xvfb this script started is killed. A build with -DMMA_ALLOW_TEST_INPUTS=ON
# supplies libalsa_readi_shim.so for the microphone in 4; without it that
# part is skipped.
