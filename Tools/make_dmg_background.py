"""Generate the macOS disk-image background.

The window a Mac user opens is the whole install experience, so it says what to
do rather than leaving them to guess: the app on the left, the Applications
folder on the right, an arrow between them, and the one first-launch step
underneath. Same §9.2 palette as the app and the icon.
